# Releasing

Releases for this repository are automated with [release-plz](https://release-plz.dev/).

## Normal flow

1. When changes are pushed to `main`, release-plz automatically creates or updates a release PR.
2. Review the release PR (version, `CHANGELOG.md`, `Cargo.toml`).
3. Merging the PR creates the `v{version}` tag, the GitHub release, publishes to crates.io, and builds CLI binaries for each target platform. To (re)upload them for an existing tag, run "Release binaries" manually with that tag. Both use the organization's shared workflows ([sapphire-turtle/.github](https://github.com/sapphire-turtle/.github)).

## Version bump rules

release-plz infers the version from conventional commits (assuming pre-1.0 `0.x.y`).

- `feat:` / `fix:` / `chore(deps):` and other non-breaking changes → patch bump
- `feat!:` / `chore!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → minor bump
- Public API changes you make yourself (function signatures, public struct fields, etc.) → minor bump (mark the commit with `!`)

When an error type re-exposes a foreign crate via `#[from] some_crate::Error`, a major bump of that dependency is technically breaking, but the practical impact is usually nil. Patch is generally fine — this is the pragmatic stance most of the Rust ecosystem takes.

## Special case: `-sys` crate updates

A major bump of a `-sys` crate (`libgit2-sys`, `libsqlite3-sys`, `openssl-sys`, anything with `links = "..."` in its Cargo.toml) **must** become a minor bump on our side.

Reason: Cargo refuses to resolve a dependency graph that contains two different majors of the same `links`-bearing crate. If we ship a patch release that pulls in a new `-sys` major, downstream crates that pin a different `-sys` major fail to build. This is a hard error, not an API compatibility break, and the user cannot work around it.

The [Cargo SemVer guide's `-sys` section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html) explicitly treats this as a major change.

### Dependencies to watch for

No published crate in this workspace currently depends on a `-sys` crate. Re-check this rule whenever a new dependency (or a new optional feature) is added.

### How to handle it

When a release PR includes a dependency update, check the CHANGELOG. If any of the above are involved:

1. Push to the release PR branch and change `workspace.package.version` in `Cargo.toml` from patch to minor.
2. Update the version heading (and the compare URL) in `CHANGELOG.md` to match.
3. Add a one-line note to the CHANGELOG entry explaining why (e.g. "pulls in a new major of `libsqlite3-sys`").

## Required secrets

- `RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN`: fine-grained PAT with Contents + Pull requests read/write.
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: used for crates.io publishing.
